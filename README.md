![Lint Code Base](https://github.com/cedriking/permaweb-dropper/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg?branch=master)

Permaweb Dropper is a simple webtool that allow users to upload (deploy) files to Arweave's permaweb without having to download `node.js + npm + arkb` or having to create your own webpage and integrate `arweave-js` and build everything from scratch to only upload a single (or a few) file(s).

If you're planning to keep deploying data to Arweave, it is best to have `arkb` installed: https://github.com/textury/arkb

## âœ¨ Features:
- Integration with ArConnect
- No file size limit.
- Works on any permaweb gateway.
- Able to upload multiple files at once.
- Able to set your own tags.
- Lightweight, minimalist and fast.
- It doesn't store your wallet, your browser, nothing that could track you.
